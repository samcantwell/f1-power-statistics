# F1 Power Statistics
This script uses the `fastf1` python package to calculate the power output of each engine during the 2018-2021 Formula 1 seasons.
It does this by finding the maximum acceleration sustained during a race weekend and uses that to generate a value for power, assuming all cars weigh 740kg each. This shouldn't be used to get an accurate power reading from an individual team, but can be used to compare power between engine types and teams
